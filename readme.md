# SC Programming
Hi, I'm Simon Crouch and welcome to my programming blog.
I love open source, free software and I am completely self-taught in VBA, SQL, AutoHotKey and my favourite: Python.

I work in the NHS, have done for years and will share some tips and software hacks here for all to benefit from.

## Software Documentation
It's amazed me how there's almost no completely free software to help you make IT training documents or even 
screenshots. See [this page](https://MrSimonC.github.io/software-documentation) for my free, easy, open 
source 
solution.
Windows 7 comes with `psr.exe`, which will screenshot (up to 100 times) when run, but this produces poor
 quality shots.
